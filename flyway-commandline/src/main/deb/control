Description: Agile Database Migration Framework for Java
 Flyway is a popular open source database migration framework
 for Java. It brings structure and confidence to the evolution
 of your database schema. It is really easy to use, yet powerful
 and both developer and DBA-friendly. Flyway supports
 the industryâ€™s most common databases including Oracle, SQL Server,
 DB2, MySQL, PostgreSQL, HsqlDB, H2 and Derby. Migrations can
 be written in plain old SQL or Java and can be executed through
 the API, the Maven plugin, the Ant tasks or the Command-Line tool.
